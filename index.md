## About Me

I am a final-year Ph.D. student (CIFRE) at EURECOM, Sorbonne University and HUAWEI Paris Research Center, 
adviced by Pietro Michiardi, Alessandro Finamore, and Giulio Franzese. 
Before that, 
I received my double Master/Engineering degree in Data Science from CentraleSup√©lec and in System Engineering from Beihang University, 
and my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beihang University.
I also interned at HUAWEI Paris Research Center and EDF R&D France. My research focuses on:

- Generative models for multimodality: 
Generative models (e.g. Diffusion Models, Flow Matching models) for multimodal conditional generation (e.g. Text-to-Image) still face challenges on aligning the generated samples with complex condition signals.
I develop generative models-based Multual Information (MI) estimators, and use MI to guide model alignment.


- Data augmentation for network Traffic Classification (TC)
In TC, large-scale datasets with high-quality labeling is expensive. 
To alleviate this burden,
I develop augmentation methods by hand-crafted function and generative models to boost classifiers' generalization and robustness in multiple use cases.



## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** multimodality generative models, mutual information
- **Traffic Classification:** generative data augmentation, contrastive learning
